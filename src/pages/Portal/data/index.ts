          'Fortunately, they can survive for several weeks without watering, and even if their leaves shrink due to lack of water, there is no need to be afraid, because succulents quickly retain their shape after watering. It is better to water them more often in the spring, during intensive growth (about once a week), in the summer and in the heat - a little less, and in winter once a month is enough. Interesting fact: cacti are not watered at all from the end of September to April, and at this time it is also necessary to reduce their temperature, which should not exceed 12-15 degrees. Other succulents, fortunately, do not require this.',

          'Succulents do not require frequent changes of pot or substrate. Repotting succulents is usually done once every 3-4 years when the existing pot becomes too tight (for example, roots protruding above the surface of the soil and through holes in the bottom of the pot) or when the substrate is sterilized (for example, plant waste). Be sure to change the soil of newly acquired plants because they are usually planted in peat soil, which is not suitable for them. It is best to repot succulents in the spring, before the period of intensive growth, like many other plants. With new plants, the season does not play such a big role.',

So, for example, if your garden is predominantly pastel shades, then you need to choose varieties of peonies that are calmer or closer to your shades in the garden.

But for example, several varieties planted in the same place will advantageously frame the mighty trunk of a tall neighbor. Otherwise, peonies combine perfectly with deciduous shrubs, roses, and other beautifully flowering perennials: daylilies, astilbes and others.

It doesn’t matter what color your seedling is, it will highlight the emerald lawn and create a contrasting decorative element in any area of the garden. For solitary plantings, we do not recommend choosing varieties that have large flowers and insufficiently strong stems - the bush will have to be equipped with a special support, risking the decorativeness of the final result. These varieties often include terry species. They are the ones who can boast of the impressive size of the buds, under the weight of which the shoots bend strongly.',

Look at the leaves. They should be a healthy green color, with no brown or yellow spots. The roots are elastic, sagging leaves indicate that the bud will quickly fade or crumble. The bouquet looks more beautiful when all the buds have opened. But by buying flowers that have not yet bloomed, you will extend their life in the vase for another couple of days. This is especially true for tulips: choose completely closed buds, with a green lower part. Roses are also worth buying when they have just begun to bloom: lightly squeeze the flower in your hand - the bud should be elastic, not soft.',

That’s why we still put two, four, six, etc. on the graves of loved ones. flower as a reminder to the deceased person that he is remembered. However, not all nationalities share this opinion. For example, in America quantity does not play any role at all. And in Asia, the science of floriography was created, where the laws of giving bouquets were written down. She interprets everything differently: even compositions bring good luck and prosperity to the family. Let's talk about rose. There are also plenty of superstitions about this flower. But the most important thing is that, just as many centuries ago, the rose is the queen of all flora and is given special preference. In the Christian Bible, it was painted as the most beautiful and pure flower without thorns that grew in paradise. But after the fall of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Eden, the plant grew thorns, which should always remind of the unworthy act of two lovers who dared to contradict the creator himself. In Ancient Rome, they worshiped this plant, gave it preference, and grew it not only on the ground, but also in pots. Men even found a place for her image on the family coat of arms and considered her a symbol of courage and strength. In Greece, an unopened rosebud was considered a sign of infinity, which has neither beginning nor end.",

However, the set, made up of 13 units, has another interpretation that refutes the myths. It shows the true attitude of a mature man towards his other half. By doing this, he shows not only love, but also respect for his wife. Such a number of plants given to a young girl for her thirteenth birthday will not bring any negativity. One of the legends says that the longer the bouquet stands, the stronger the feelings of the giver. If the queen of the garden withered on the second day, then it was not presented from a pure heart.
